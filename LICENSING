DUAL LICENSING

If your application includes or links to the litereplica code you will need a license.

The litereplica code is released under one of these 2 licenses:

    GNU Affero GPL v3
    Commercial License

Use the first option if your application is released under a license compatible with the GNU AGPL v3. This means also releasing the source code.

Otherwise you must purchase a commercial license.
